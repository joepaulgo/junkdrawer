Working with the marketing team at Zocdoc my role as freelancer includes development of partner pages in `Wordpress` using the `Advanced Custom Fields` plugin to create easy to use templates.

I've also worked with the on-staff wordpress developer to develop redesigned [career-list](https://www.zocdoc.com/about/careers-list/) and career-detail pages, as well as consult and collaborate on updating various pages in the '/about/' section of [Zocdoc.com](https://www.zocdoc.com).

Other smaller requests included bumpers for youtube videos, email development of Google Sponsored Promotions, as well as wireframes for new marketing pages.
